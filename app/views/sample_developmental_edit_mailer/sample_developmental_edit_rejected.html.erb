<p>Hi <%= @sample_developmental_edit.user.first_name %>.</p>
<p>Thank you for submitting to BubbleCow for a free sample. Unfortunately, we do not feel that your book is a good match for our services. We will, therefore, not be providing a sample edit.</p> 
<p>There are many reasons why we rejected samples, the most common being:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The manuscript requires too much work for our editing approach.</li>
	<li>We don’t edit the type of work. We currently do not accept poetry, short stories, cookbooks or highly technical non-fiction.</li>
	<li>We don’t have the correct type of editor.</li>
</ul>

<p>I would like to suggest two things you can do at this point:</p>

<p>Read our <a href="https://bubblecow.com/writing-manual">free ebook on writing</a>. This will highlight our editing style and steps you can take to improve your book.</p>
<p>Consider employing a freelance editor. I’d suggest you try <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/search/gigs?utf8=%E2%9C%93&source=top-bar&locale=en&search_in=everywhere&query=book+editing">Fiverr</a>.</p>
<p>I wish you all the best for your book.</p>
<p>Please don't hesitate to email if you have any questions.</p>
<p>Gary Smailes</p>
