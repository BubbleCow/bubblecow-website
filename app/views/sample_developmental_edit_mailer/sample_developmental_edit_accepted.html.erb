<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for submitting your book for sample developmental editing.</p>
<p>I am delighted to say that I feel we can add value to your book and will be happy to carry out a sample edit.</p>
<p>However, before we can proceed, we find that it is helpful for writers if we clearly outline the <strong>cost</strong> and <strong>time frame</strong> of a full edit.</p>
<p>This sample developmental edit will be carried out <em>FREE OF CHARGE</em>.</p>
<p>If, once you have received your sample edit, you were happy and wish to proceed to a full edit the cost would be <%= developmental_edit_quote(@sample_developmental_edit) %>.</p>
<p>This is cost based on a word count of <%= number_with_delimiter(@sample_developmental_edit.word_count) %>. If this word count alters, the cost will also alter. You can find a cost calculator <a href="https://bubblecow.com/book-editing">here</a>.</p>
<p>All developmental edits are completed within twenty-eight working days of payment. For example, if you were to submit today, your edit would be returned on, or before, <%= proposed_developmental_edit_due_date %>.</p>
<p>Please ensure that your publication timetable allows time for both this edit, plus any extra re-writes. We typically suggest you allow one-to-two weeks for re-writes.</p>
<p>If you are happy with both the potential cost and the editing timetable, then I would love to provide you with a free sample edit.</p>
<p><strong>To proceed, just hit reply and let us know that you are happy to move forward.</strong> If would also help if you could tell us a little about you publication plans. Are you intending to self-publish or will you be seeking a traditional publishing route?</p>
<p>It you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask either via email or we can set up a chat.</p>
<p>Gary Smailes</p>
