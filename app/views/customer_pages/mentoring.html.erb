                    <h2>What is Mentoring?</h2>
                    <p>Mentoring for writers is the process of partnering with an experienced professional writer, editor, and mentor to help lift your book to a publishable standard.</p>
                    <p>You will work closely with your mentor to make your book the best it can be.</p>
                    <p>The goal of working with a writing mentor is to develop a long-term professional relationship with someone that has the knowledge and commitment to help you lift your book to the next level.</p>
                    <p>Not only will your mentor provide you with the skill and guidance needed to be a success, but they will also provide you with the knowledge needed to publish with confidence.</p> 
                    <p>We understand that budgets can be tight for writers, so we have developed an approach to mentoring that is <strong>cost-effective, personal, and professional</strong>. It will give you the maximum amount of long-term benefit for your investment. </p>

                    <h2>The Process</h2>
                    <p>Mentoring is carried out in 15,000 word ‘chunks’.</p>
                    <p>There’s no contract and no commitment beyond each 15,000 word chunk. You only pay for what you submit.</p> 
                    <p>This means that you are never tied into an expensive long-term contract. Unlike other companies, we are not expecting you to commit to paying thousands before you have any inclination as to whether the process is correct for you and your book.</p> 
                    <p>You remain in control at all times, developing a relationship that fits you, your book, and your budget. </p>
                     <p>This process continues for as long as you require.</p> 
                    <p>The process is as follows:</p>
                    
                    <h3>Step 1 - Submission</h3>
                    <p>To begin the mentoring process you must submit the first 15,000 words of your book.</p> 
                    <p>You must submit the section of your book that will be first edited.</p>
                    <p>We will assess your submission and get back to you, via email, within twenty-four hours. </p>
                    <p>If your book is accepted (we accept about 75% of submissions), you can move to the next step. We only accept books that we feel are in a position for us to add significant value. We, also, only accept books that we feel are suitable for our small team of handpicked mentors. </p>
                    
                    <h3>Step 2 - Payment</h3>
                    <p>Once your book is accepted, you will be sent an invoice with payment details. This email invoice will contain a link to our online payment system. You can pay using a card or PayPal. We can bill in whatever currency is best for you.</p> 

                    <h3>Step 3 - Planning</h3>
                    <p>You will receive an introductory email from your mentor. This will give you both a chance to start to develop a working relationship. It will also allow you to explain any elements of your book that you feel are important to the writing, editing, and publishing process.</p> 
                    <p>Working with your mentor, you will establish two dates that fit with your writing schedule.</p> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>The date the editorial feedback will be returned to you. </li>
                        <li>The date of the one-on-one, hour-long, online meeting. </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Step 4 - Editing</h3>
                    <p>Once your mentor has read and edited your manuscript, they will return the completed editorial feedback. This will consist of tracked changes and comments within your manuscript, as well as a detailed editor’s report.</p> 
                    <p>This feedback will provide you with a clear road map on what you need to do to improve your book.</p> 

                    <h3>Step 5 - Feedback</h3>
                    <p>On the date and time agreed, you will virtually meet with your mentor to discuss your feedback.</p> 
                    <p>This is a collaborative meeting in which the mentor will have key topics they wish to discuss. However, you are free to enter into discussion about any aspect of your book, the writing process or even eventual publication.</p> 

                    <h4>Step 6 - Repeat</h4>
                    <p>Once you have received your feedback, and had your meeting with your mentor, then you are set for the next step. </p>
                    <p>To move forward, you will be given the time you need to implement any lessons you have learned or make changes you feel are important.</p> 
                    <p>To continue the mentoring process, simply submit the next 15,000 words, and the process restarts. If you wish, you can resubmit a previously submitted extract, though this is only recommended if you have made significant alterations. </p>
                    <p>Your relationship with your mentor has no fixed limits and can extend for as long a period of time as you wish, allowing you to submit as many 15,000 word ‘chunks’ as you need. </p>
                    <p>You remain in control at all points, and you can fit the process around your writing goals and budget.</p>

                    <h2>Editorial Feedback</h2>
                    <p>The role of the mentor is to help you lift your book to the next level, ensuring it is the best it can be.</p>
                    <p>Unlike other types of feedback, the type of editing provided by a mentor is more about the mentor’s education, experience, and gut feeling than following a pre-written manual of instructions.</p>
                    <p>This means that the mentor’s skill is critical. However, to ensure that we approach every book in the same way, our mentors apply several questions to each book that they edit.</p>
                    <p>Here are a few of the questions (there are more, but they are often genre-specific):</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Does the structure of the book make sense?</li>
                        <li>Is the presentation logical?</li>
                        <li>Is there a wider story arc that engages the reader and pulls them through the narrative?</li>
                        <li>Has a coherent viewpoint been applied? Is it consistent? Does it make sense for the story?</li>
                        <li>Does the chapter structure make sense? Does the writer understand scene structure?</li>
                        <li>Have narrative techniques been correctly applied?</li>
                        <li>Does each scene contain sufficient description?</li>
                        <li>Is each new character sufficiently described?</li>
                        <li>Is the tense consistent?</li>
                        <li>Is the characterization believable and consistent?</li>
                        <li>Are the characters sufficiently developed?</li>
                        <li>Are there any obvious plot holes?</li>
                        <li>If the novel is set in the past, are there any inconsistencies in the use of objects etc.?</li>
                        <li>Does the book's voice, style, and format match the genre expectations?</li>
                        <li>Is the writer telling, when they should be showing?</li>
                        <li>Are the facts accurate?</li>
                        <li>Does the book's word count meet the genre expectations? If it is too short, how can it be extended? If too long, what approach should be taken?</li>
                        <li>Has the writer correctly formatted paragraphs? Will shorter or longer paragraphs better suit the style or genre of the book?</li>
                        <li>If a prologue is used, does it match the genre and make sense to the wider narrative?</li>
                        <li>Does the book need an introduction?</li>
                        <li>Does the book need additional end material, such as a bibliography or epilogue?</li>
                        <li>Should the writer include information about themselves?</li>
                        <li>If relevant, is the book correctly referenced?</li>
                        <li>If images, tables and diagrams have been used, has the copyright been correctly attributed?</li>
                        <li>If included, are all footnotes or endnotes correctly presented and formatted?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 id="item-6">Embedded Comments</h3>
                    <p>When editing your book, your mentor will constantly be applying the questions above and will have a collection of thoughts and suggestions that will improve your manuscript.</p>
                    <p>We fundamentally believe that our role is to guide and suggest but the control of the final changes should always remain with the writer. After all, you have the clearest vision for your book.</p>
                    <p>One way that we communicate our thoughts and feelings on your book is by the use of embedded comments.</p>

                    <p>These 'comments' are part of Word's editing tools and they will appear automatically when you open up the edited manuscript. If not, then it is just a simple matter of changing one of the settings in Word. This is easy to do.</p>
                    <p>There are no 'rules' as to what we will and will not include, and it changes with each writer and each book. However, we see these comments as a way to start a 'dialogue' with the writer. They are our way of highlighting a small section of the book and suggesting what might be wrong and what you need to do to improve that section.</p>

                    <h3 id="item-7">Editor's Report</h3></p>
                    <p>In addition to embedded comments, you will also receive an editor’s report. This document will be your mentor’s thoughts on your book.</p>
                    <p>It is a broad overview of the key issues and will act as a ‘jumping off point’ when you come to consider the changes to apply to your book.</p>
                    <p>The report will highlight any key issues that have surfaced during the edit. The mentor will explain why they feel that the issue needs addressing, provide examples of where the issue is a problem (often in conjunction with the embedded comments within the manuscript), and then provide at least one solution that can be applied to fix the problem.</p>

                    <h3 id="item-8">One to One Meeting</h3>
                    <p>The manuscript and editor’s report will give you a clear indication of what is wrong with your book and what you need to do to fix any problems. This feedback is supported by an hour-long, one-to-one mentoring session. </p>
                    <p>This will take place either via video conference (Zoom or Skype) or via telephone. </p>
                    <p>In the meeting, your mentor will address all of the key feedback, providing detailed explanations as to what they think is wrong and what you can do to fix any issues. </p>
                    <p>You will also be given the opportunity to raise any questions you may have about your book, the feedback, or the writing process in general. </p>

                   <h2>When should you get a manuscript assessment?</h2>
                    <p>Deciding when the time is right for a manuscript assessment is a personal choice, depending on you and your book.</p>
                    <p>However, there are several common scenarios in which a professional manuscript evaluation is the correct choice.</p>
                    <h3>You are stuck and don't know what to do next?</h3>
                    <p>Let's face it, creative writing is hard.</p>
                    <p>Imagine working on the first draft of a novel, but you have come to a grinding halt; perhaps the book has lost momentum, or the structure isn't working the way you had hoped, or you have just run out of ideas.</p>
                    <p>At this point, you don't want to invest in a full developmental edit and just need some guidance to kickstart the writing process; this is when a manuscript assessment is a perfect choice.</p>
                    <p>An assessment will give you a clear outline of what is working and what you need to do to get the book to the next stage, without breaking the bank.</p>
                    <h3>You are worried your book is just not good enough</h3>
                    <p>After investing hours developing your book, be that fiction or non-fiction, you are now at a stage where you are just not sure that your work is good enough.</p>
                    <p>You have been focusing on writing for so long that you can't see the wood for the trees.</p>
                    <p>This is when an assessment is a great option.</p>
                    <p>A professional assessment of your work will give you a clear indication of what you are doing right and what's not working the way you had hoped. The evaluation will provide you with a clear roadmap to what you need to do to lift the book to a publishable standard.</p>
                    <h3>It's just the wrong time for developmental editing</h3>
                    <p>A professional developmental edit is an essential part of the publication process, but only when the time is right.</p>
                    <p>A developmental edit is an intense and comprehensive assessment of every element of your book. It’s what you need when you have taken your writing as far as you possibly can without outside help.</p>
                    <p>If you are confident that your book is close to being publication-ready, it is probably time to invest in developmental editing.</p>
                    <p>However, what if you are not that confident your book is ready for the world?</p>
                    <p>What if you are still at the first draft stage but want professional feedback?</p>
                    <p>What if you know there are issues with your story, but you still need some guidance on the best way forward?</p>
                    <p>In these situations, a full developmental edit is just not the right choice. Instead, a manuscript assessment will give you the feedback you need.</p>
                    <h3>You are thinking about approaching an agent</h3>
                    <p>If you are considering the traditional publishing route, then, at some point, you will need to consider a literary agent before you can approach a publishing house.</p>
                    <p>However, you know you only get one chance with a literary agent, and you want to make sure there are no glaring issues with your book.</p>
                    <p>The last thing you want is for your book to be rejected because you missed a simple solution to fix the problem.</p>
                    <p>This is when a manuscript appraisal is a good option. It will give you an assessment of your book, without having to invest in a full developmental edit.</p>
                    <h3>Your budget is tight</h3>
                    <p>Let's not kid ourselves; publishing a book requires a budget. Sometimes, you just don't have the money to stretch to all the bells and whistles.</p>
                    <p>While an assessment is not a replacement for a more comprehensive developmental edit, it will provide you with essential feedback at a price that will fit your budget.</p>
                    <p>So, when the money's tight, but you still need professional feedback, an assessment might just be the answer.</p>

                        <div class="accordion-body">
                        <p>No, but we accept most fiction genres and all major nonfiction genres. In fact, we
                            say yes to about 75% of the books that are submitted.</p>
                        <p>Our goal is to add maximum value to writers. However, for this to happen we have to be the correct
                            editors for your book. </p>
                        <p>The most common reason we will reject a book is that the book is not far enough down the writing
                            process for a <%= @keyword %> edit to be of maximum value.</p>
                        <p>For example, if a book is at the ‘first draft’ stage and contains many very simple errors, we will
                            say
                            no. If a book’s formatting and structure are non-existent (e.g. it has no paragraphs) we will also say
                            no. If the book sentence structure is ‘unusual’ (most common when English is not the writer’s first
                            language), we will reject the manuscript with the suggestion that further 'low level’ editorial work
                            is
                            applied before it is ready for a <%= @keyword %> edit.</p>
                        <p>The second most common reason we say no to a book is that we don’t have the editorial experience for
                            the genre.</p>
                        <p>We pride ourselves on both having experience in editing and deep genre knowledge. We spend a lot of
                            time talking to writers, publishers and agents and have a good understanding of what the current
                            trends
                            in the marketplace look like.</p>
                        <p>This means that if your book is not within a genre in which we specialize, we are not the best people
                            for the job.</p>
