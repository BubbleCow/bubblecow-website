    <h1 class="mb-3">The BubbleCow Story</h1>
    <p>In 2007, Gary Smailes started a company that would provide high quality ‘publisher’ standard book editing. Unhappy with the way most freelance editors were charging per book, he developed a much fairer ‘cost per word’ price structure and BubbleCow was born.</p>
    <h2>Serving Writers</h2>
    <p>Today, BubbleCow is one of the leading editing companies and serves self-published writers from all around the world. BubbleCow has edited more than 1000 books and played a small part in hundreds of writers achieving their dreams.</p>
    <p>At the heart of the company is one fundamental belief: Storytelling is an art, but writing is a craft.</p>
    <h2>Future</h2>
    <p>BubbleCow's goal is to provide world-class editorial feedback and customer support, at a price that is affordable to self-published writers.</p>
    <p>BubbleCow is an editing company that was born into the modern world of self-publishing. We have developed a way of editing that not only shows you what’s wrong with your book but gives you all the guidance you need to fix the mistakes.</p>
    <p>For us, the quality of the feedback is everything.</p>
