My fears vanished, however, when I found Bubblecow to be so supportive. I felt that they were on my side. They communicated the process well so that I was kept informed of every step. Their emails were detailed, outlining the time-frame, and I received the edit exactly when they said I would. Also, I appreciated the advice on how to approach the finished edit, to decrease the shock of the criticism and gain the most benefit from the comments. In the event, there was no shock, just delight at reading so many positive comments and a great deal of constructive, insightful suggestions. Thank you Caroline. I can now look at my novel more objectively and I have already started to think of ideas to improve the overall plot as well as the smaller changes that were suggested.

(Was very pleased with the result). 4. Sent in my whole manuscript. 5. Gary replied the same day and we did the transaction, with other words I paid for the service. 6. Gary updated me on the things to come and went to work. 7. Around 28 business day later (that's Monday to Friday), I received the edited sample. The verdict? Not only was the feedback and edit clean and honest, but it highlighted certain aspect of my novel I'd &#8220;pushed&#8221; away, or ignored, because I wasn't sure how to tackle them then. Gary pointed out the flaws and showed me how to fix them, and from there it was all fun and games. Highly recommended. Leave your fears aside. This went very well. Thanks Gary.

I've read about and studied the techniques that you disclose. They didn't hit home until you applied them to my work. Makes sense. When one reads about how to write they're being told; through editing they're being shown. I now detect these principles in novels I'm reading. Before I didn't.

Apart from a good clean edit of the MS and an amount of clear, relevant and useful advice and insight on how to polish a number of scenes in the book, the edit came back with a pretty brave but most definite piece of advice. The book was constructed around a present day narrative with flashbacks to the protagonist's time in Beirut back in 1978 and his subsequent life as a diplomat in the Middle East. These were interwoven with the main story, which details how he returns to Beirut in the present day, dying of cancer, to rediscover the love he lost when he left back in the seventies. His past catches up with him so quickly and with such violence it threatens to kill him before the disease does. Kill the flashbacks, said Bubblecow. All of them. Wow. That was 30,000 words of rewrite right there. It takes an editor with cojones to make a call like that. I rolled up my sleeves and did it, reasoning that as I'd paid good money for Bubblecow's advice and experience, I might as well suck it up and follow their counsel. I am very glad indeed that I did.

The team at Bublecow have written many books and know what it takes to get your book ready to print. The edit for my book cleared up a lot of my mistakes that I wouldn&#8217;t of seen. Also the chapter by chapter review gave me areas that I needed to work on. I see the writing process as making a house. You may have a great idea for a house but unless you have experience and the knowledge of building a house you will have lots of problems. BubbleCow is good at building books.

Testimonial.create(testimonial_text: "Bubblecow was a revelation. Sure, I&#8217;ve had editing done before, but nothing compares to what Caroline produced; as they say, you only get what you pay for, and the money I spent with Bubblecow was well worth it. The book I sent to them had already been checked by THREE OTHER PROOFREADERS! Yet, when my manuscript came back from Caroline, it was a revelation. Okay, it took over three weeks, and I did ask for editing, but I could see the diligence that had been put into my work by Caroline. I took on board the technical/typo/grammar/timeline comments, and, in all honesty, I feel I now have a tighter, more focused novel. Additionally, the downloads available helped me to produce a much better agent&#8217;s letter. The &#8216;Tag Line&#8217;, &#8216;Elevator pitch&#8217;, and the synopsis guidelines alone were priceless. Thank you, Bubblecow. I have another book waiting to off to Bubblecow (Christmas put a hole in my budget), and I just know it will come back much improved. I now look back on my earlier work and cringe. This is a genuine testimonial, and any non-believers are more than welcome to get in touch with me personally. Find me on Google. ", writer: "Revell Cornell")

BubbleCow were available before, during and after the edit for help and advice about the next steps. Gary even helped me get in contact with an agent. Overall, I was really satisfied with BubbleCow and if you are thinking about having your novel professionally edited, firstly, do it, secondly seriously consider using BubbleCow. I am glad I did.

Testimonial.create(testimonial_text: "When I opened my novel I was surprised to find that there were around 5,000 edits and suggestions for my story. That's crazy. I never expected so much attention to detail. But it was all the notes that accompanied the edits that really impressed me. Suggestions to make sentences more active. Notes on consistency. Additions to avoid confusion. Even a couple additional paragraphs to help foreshadow events to come. While going through the edits, I started to wonder if the editor knew my book better than I did. All the feedback was great and incredibly helpful, and it turned a story I felt was good into something I could be truly proud of. ", writer: "Kevin Wolfenberger")
Testimonial.create(testimonial_text: "The feedback and suggested changes were invaluable. I spent over a year organizing and reworking my material. I felt my ideas were solid, but the book was a choppy read. My editor from bubblecow changed that. When I received the suggested revisions, I sat down and gave it a read-through. It flowed so well, I caught myself lost in my own content! And I thought, Now I've got a book I'm comfortable selling. Thank you bubblecow. You'll definitely be receiving my next book for revisions as well. ", writer: "David Ihrig")
Testimonial.create(testimonial_text: "I thought I had written the world's greatest book. I'm sure this is true of most authors. I debated for quite a while whether or not to send my book to BubbleCow for editing. Having my book read and edited by BubbleCow was one of the best decisions I have made. My experience with them taught me that I was too close to my writing and could not see the many flaws that existed. I hate to admit that BubbleCow improved my manuscript 100%, but they did. They were able to catch silly mistakes as well as glaring errors. BubbleCow's excellent critique was written with sincere kindness and encouragement! The suggestions and excellent edits made by BubbleCow made my book so much better. My money was well spent, and I wouldn't hesitate to submit another manuscript to them. I strongly encourage other authors to do the same. ", writer: "Joyce Schwartz")
Testimonial.create(testimonial_text: "My advice is this: Look no more if you want a great editor because you've come to the right place. I am not related nor have any affiliation with BubbleCow. I am simply a very happy customer. I love the fact that BubbleCow provided me the best editor/proofreader I've ever had. In fact, their services are so good they are currently finishing up with my third book in my series–The Chronicles of Jamaica–and my editor will also be working on the fourth in three weeks, the fifth, the sixth, the seven, and the eighth will also go through BubbleCow. I could not be any happier. I've had horrible editors that yelled, belittled, died, and left me hanging. One editor even told me that I could not use the word &#8220;voodoo&#8221; in a book. Good luck to all you authors in need of a good editor, and remember, this is the place you'll find one. ", writer: "B. J. Ramsey")
Testimonial.create(testimonial_text: "The line edit was valuable. I'd spent more than two month's rewriting and self-editing my book prior to submitting it to BubbleCow. This and the fact that it's quite a short nonfiction e-book (around 11600 words), made me doubtful that much, if anything, could be done to improve it further. But I was pleasantly surprised. The editor's corrections, especially the deletions, helped to sharpen the message and improve the flow. The decisiveness with which the corrections were made showed that the edit had been done by an experienced professional. The work was completed 4 days ahead of schedule. I was very happy with the service. Thank You. ", writer: "Joe Cain")

It highlighted the positives and negatives, while also backing up the insight with thoughtful explanations as to why the adjustments were important to the reader. The editor gave me the confidence to pursue my dream and armed me with tips &amp; techniques to improve my writing as a whole. Saying it was worth the money would be an understatement.

The breakdown of chapters, what was good and what was bad, not only gave me focus but also helped turn my book into something even more amazing than what I previously thought.

The editor tells me where I have parts which detract and which are not strong – but my main voice and, incidentally the one I was more convinced by as a writer, she is full of praise for. I think one of the main things I wanted to check by asking for an edit, was whether what I was writing was actually worth it – and whether there was potential or not. The editor really encouraged me by enthusing about one line of the story and then made the enthusing believable by being honest about the parts that didn't work. That's an insight I would not be able to have as the writer and I appreciate it deeply. ", writer: "Kate Dibb")
